          In order to make it easier for users, rather than forcing them to download things like Word docs, PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, and open office documents (In addition to requiring that those programs be installed on their on their computer), in many areas throughout Canvas, it will allow you an inline preview of the document.
          
          If Scribd has been enabled for this account, it will try to use it to show the preview. But because Scribd uses flash paper to display the documents, and many users (namely those using an iPad/iPhone) do not have Flash Player installed, that preview will not work.  By leaving Google Docs Previews enabled, when a browser does not have Flash enabled, or if Scribd is not enabled, it will use preview powered by Google Docs.

            Course modules let you organize your assignments, pages, files, etc. into smaller sections or units. Modules could be centered around a theme, focused on a specific topic, or even just grouped chronologically.
            
            You can also sequence modules by defining criteria and prerequisites for each module. Students won't be able to access modules until they have unlocked all their prerequisites. That way you can prevent students from accessing certain content or files until they have, say, gotten at least 75% on a review quiz.

            Hashtags are special phrases that let people consistently mention the same idea (like a course) on web sites like Twitter.  For example, the message "I like #instructure" is using the hashtag "instructure".
            
            Hashtags should consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores (no spaces).  The hashtag should be unique, easily recognizable, and short.  Short hashtags are better since sites like Twitter limit the number of letters per message.

            ePortfolios are a place where you can display and discuss the significant
            submissions and experiences that are happening during your learning
            process. You can use an ePortfolio to:
            
            * Display the papers you're proud of for more than just your instructor to see
            * Talk about all the thought and work that went into your class submissions
            * Gather an overview of your educational experience as a whole
            * Share your work with friends, future employers, etc.
            
            ePortfolios can be public for everyone to see, or private so only those you
            allow can see, and you can change that setting at any time.

          You can create sets of groups where students can sign up on their own.
          Students are still limited to being in only one group in the set, but this way
          students can organize themselves into groups instead of needing the teacher to
          do the work. You can also require that group members all be part of the same
          course section.
          
          Keep in mind, students can move themselves from one group to another, so when
          your students are done organizing themselves you may want to disable self
          sign-ups.
